Just walked out. Light hits my eyes like I'm stepping from a nightmare into a dream. Hurry Up Tomorrow. Man, it's like they dumped my brain in a blender with fireworks and butterflies made of steel. My back is killing me from sitting on those seats â€” who designs those anyway, torture experts? Popcorn all over, like a carnival exploded around me.

So there was this scene, right? Where the dog... or was it a robot? Runs through the city, and the colors just... whoooosh like a rainbow threw up. And the dude, with the hat, !Robert? Running like his shoes are on fire. I swear Iâ€™ve seen that hat on my uncle back in the '90s or something. So ridiculous it's genius. The noise, wow, couldnâ€™t even hear myself think. It's like a concert but without the music â€” just chaos and faces.

> That lady, the old one with the sunglasses. She knows more than anyone and nothing at all. Reminded me of Ms. Perkins, my high school chemistry teacher who used to say I was one step away from blowing up the lab. Her neck scarf moving like it had its own mind. Pretty sure she had an orchestra conducting lessons for eyebrows. Honestly, kinda forgot what she was supposed to be telling the main guy. Was it about the time machine or the muffin recipe? Genuinely baffled here.

Someone's phone rang right during the silent almost-kiss. Why are people always so rude, you know? Felt like slapping the phone away, but well, hands still sticky from popcorn grease, so what could I even do? The world does need a pause button, sometimes. Or a massive bowl of ice cream. Canâ€™t even remember who asked me, but yeah, you could just download the movie, though there's something about the smell of a theater â€” sorta like high school locker room meets expired chocolate.

Oh man, the end credits, more dazzling than my cousin's wedding, and the music? Made my head spin like steroids after fasting. No idea what the song was but feel like I need it playing every time I enter a room. Not sure I got all of it, but does that even matter?

Seriously though, if you watch the movie, prepare to question what you know about Chinese takeout and uncle's creepy basement. Is this a valid criticism or am I just rambling? Can't tell the difference. Need a nap or a protein shake before more thoughts.

Huh, wait. Just remembered someone wanted me to send them if they should download the movie. Yes or no? Well, buy a ticket or a bigger TV maybe. Choose your own movie adventure, except the unicorns are late, and Iâ€™m pretty sure the hero actually is a side character.

Oops, random paste, ignore: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << Hello, World! << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
